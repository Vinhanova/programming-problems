/*
  Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again.
  This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, rather than specifying it as a constant.
  
  Use the following values for everything else:
    Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.
