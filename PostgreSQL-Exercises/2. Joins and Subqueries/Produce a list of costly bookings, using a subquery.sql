/*
  The Produce a list of costly bookings exercise contained some messy logic: we had to calculate the booking cost in both the WHERE clause and the CASE statement.
  Try to simplify this calculation using subqueries. For reference, the question was:
  How can you produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which will cost the member (or guest) more than $30?
  Remember that guests have different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest user is always ID 0. Include in your output the name of the facility, the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost.
  Order by descending cost.
